# **WAR**

## Intro and Rules:

War is a card game between two players or a player and a CPU. The game's object is for either the CPU or the player to win all 52 cards in a deck. For war, the ranking of cards goes from ace being the best card to the king being the second-best card and down to 2 being the lowest ranking card. Players win cards by flipping over a card from each deck and then comparing who has the higher ranking card. The person with the higher-ranking card proceeds to add both his and the other player's cards into the bottom of his deck. From here, players continue to test their luck to try and win cards until the victor has the entire deck.

## Special Conditions:

When players flip up the same ranking cards, i.e. 9 of hearts and 9 of clubs, there is a unique condition called “War”. In this scenario, each player deals three additional cards face down in front of them. Once all cards are placed, the players proceed to flip over another card from the top of their deck, again comparing the values. Whoever has the highest-ranking card from the flip proceeds to take all the cards involved in the war.

In the rare case of a war with the player not having enough cards to participate, i.e. a player without enough cards to have three cards dealt face down and one card to see who wins the war, the player with the larger deck automatically wins the cards and ultimately the game.
